# Errors

Errors
When working with JavaScript, different errors can occur. There are several ways of handling them:

try — Lets you define a block of code to test for errors
catch — Set up a block of code to execute in case of an error
throw — Create custom error messages instead of the standard JavaScript errors
finally — Lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result

JavaScript also has a built-in error object. It has two properties:

name — Sets or returns the error name
